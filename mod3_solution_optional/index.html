        <h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h2>
        <p>The restaurant was founded in 1987 in the Johannesburg suburb Rosettenville when Portuguese-born audio engineer Fernando Duarte took his entrepreneur friend Robert Brozin to a Portuguese takeaway called Chickenland for a meal. After trying the chicken – cooked in piri piri, a chilli sauce originating in Mozambique – they bought the restaurant for about 80,000 Rand (equivalent of about £25,000 at the time). They renamed the restaurant Nando's, after Fernando. After two years the restaurant had four outlets – three in Johannesburg and one in Portugal. By 2013, around 1,000 Nando's branches were located in 35 countries.</p>

        <p>In 2010, Advertising Age magazine named Nando's as one of the world's top 30 hottest marketing brands. As of July 2014, the Nando's restaurant group is ultimately owned by South African businessman Dick Enthoven and his family. Enthoven's son, Robby Enthoven, was responsible for expanding the Nando's chain in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
        <p>Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.</p>

      <div id="menu-sushi" class="dish">
        <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
        <p>The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司,) was first made in Southeast Asia, maybe along what is also known as the Mekong River[citation needed]. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, is still made by wrapping fish in soured fermenting rice, which causes the fish proteins to break down into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish have both a sour and an umami taste.</p>
